                    <p class="basicText">Welcome! This is our problem solving/puzzle game for Global Game Jam 2015. 
                        Theme for this jam was "What do we do now?" and we had 48 hours time to get everything done. We were inspired by 
                        <a href="http://www.notpron.org/notpron">not pr0n</a>.<br /> <br />

                        The game requires a lot of patience and brains. It maybe the best to turn away now if you don't have these things. <br /> <br /> 

                        <h1 class="basicHeadline">Rules <i></i></h1><i>(protip: read these carefully)</i><br/><br/><br/>
                        To advance from room to room, enter right <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> when asked. 
                        Username is always lowercase <i>alphabets</i>, password <i>numbers</i>. These both are always without spaces. You can find hints for the 
                        problems from everywhere: in the picture, site title, address bar and so on. Courageously try out <i>out-of-the-box solutions</i>. Zooming 
                        is possible with <i>SHIFT + left mouse button</i> or traditionally with <i>CTRL + mouse scroll</i>.<br /> <br />

                        Note that this is <i>not</i> a point and click game! <i>There are some clicking elements</i> but that's it. Instead you
                        need to use <i>search engine</i> at the later levels to get the information you need. Of course that is not the
                        case if you are master of trivia.<br /><br />
